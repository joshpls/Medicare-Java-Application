<h3>"Instructions for Branch Usage"</h3>

<h3>How to pull changes from another group's development branch:</h3>

<p>1. On GitHub, navigate to the branch that you want to <strong>pull</strong> code from.
		Example: Team5 is wanting to pull code from Butterscotch. Team5 will navigate to
		Butterscotch's branch on GitHub.</p>

<p>2. After navigating to the branch with the code that is needing to be pulled, click on
		<strong>"New pull request"</strong>. This will take you to the <strong>"Open a pull
		request"</strong> page. Make sure that the <strong>"base"</strong> is the branch that
		you're pulling code to. Example: Team5 is pulling code from Butterscotch. Team5's branch
		will be the "base" branch and Butterscotch will be the "compare" branch.
		Notice that above the pull request description box, there is either an "Able to merge"
		indicator. Note: this must be green and checked.</p>
		
<p>3. After adding a description of your pull request, click on <strong>"Create new pull request"</strong></p>

<p>4. After clicking "Create new pull request," you can add a comment in the "comment box." After completing
		this field, you will need to click on <strong>"Merge pull request."</strong> Additionally, if you need
		to cancel the pull, click on <strong>"Close pull request."</strong></p>
		
		
<h3>Additional Information</h3>

<p>If you find that you are unable to push your branch to master, the reason why is most likely because
	your files are out sync, which is a requirement. To fix the issue, you first need to pull down from
	the branch you're wanting to push to and then push your updates up to the branch.
	Example: Team5 wants to push the changes that they've made on their branch to the master branch,
	however, they are unable. First, Team5 needs to pull down from the master branch. After pulling down
	from the master branch, Team5 can now push their branch up to the master.</p>
